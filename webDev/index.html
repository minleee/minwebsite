							<h2>Hello! </h2>
                <p>I am Seungmin Lee (nickname: Min). I am a sophomore who studies Information Science, Systems, and Technology (ISST) at Cornell University.
                  In the future, I hope to go further into user research studies because I have a strong passion for user experience.
                  Born in South Korea, I was raised in Northern Virginia, near DC area. Having the background as both Korean and American, I hope to
                  become a developer who can well understand the perspectives of all the users.

            <p>Moon Study:</p>
            <p>Virtual reality experiment, collaborated with the Department of Physics, to study students’ behavior as they learned phases of the moon in an interactive space. I was in charge of running the virtual experiments to collect data </p>
            <p>Social VR:</p>
            <p> In this project, I analyzed qualitative data and studied users’ behaviors in different virtual reality scenes with tasks such as creating Avatar, fishing, lifeboat, and drawing. I also transcribed interviews and did qualitative coding using Atlas.ti</p>

            <p>I worked as an intern in a start-up technology company, creating games and Virtual Reality (VR) scenes for users to learn foreign languages.

          <p>I started to learn Virtual Reality on my own from Udacity because I was intrigued by its ability to create an imagination to reality.
            From the internship, I created restaurant scene of the country that the user was learning of.</p>
          <p>Here is an example of my work - an apartment scene. </p>
