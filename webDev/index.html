							<h3>Hello! </h3>
                <h2>I am Seungmin Lee (nickname: Min). I am a sophomore who studies nformation Science, Systems, and Technology (ISST) at Cornell University.
                  In the future, I hope to go further into user research studies because I have a strong passion for user experience.
                  Born in South Korea, I was raised in Northern Virginia, near DC area. Having the background as both Korean and American, I hope to
                  become a developer who can well understand the perspectives of all the users.
